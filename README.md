# A-method-for-estimation-of-melt-pond-depth-from-ICESat-2
This code enables the estimation of melt pond depth on Arctic sea ice based on ICESat-2 data.
It is written in MATLAB and includes a main function (S1algorithm) as well as several sub-functions.
The input is ICESat-2 point-cloud data in .txt format (an example dataset has also been uploaded).
The output is the [our_data] array, which contains the pond ID, pond horizontal coordinates, pond surface elevation, and pond bottom elevation.
This code follows the methodology described in the paper [From point cloud to image: An automatic method for estimating the depth of melt ponds over Arctic sea ice using ICESat-2 LiDAR point cloud data], which is currently under review in a scientific journal. If the paper is published, we will provide further updates.
